## workflow description
In this section I will describe my workflow for this project as well as some instructions to read the notebooks and code:  
1. A project folder and git repository is generated and everything is set up on a master and a dev branch (usually other branches / stages would be used for code review and testing) 

2. Setting up the folder for an efficient workflow. This includes:
    * a workflow manager that contains relative paths in the project. This enables 3rd parties to read and run the code on their machine. 
    * a virtual environment for the project is generated and the requirement file for this python environment is added (this could be improved by using docker -> maybe I have time to set this up)   
    * labeling  

3. Taking a good look at the Data and
    * getting ideas on what analyses would be possible 
        * this includes: what interesting analyses could be done with this data
        * what audiences can be reached with this data
        *
